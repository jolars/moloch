Moloch is a simple Beamer theme suitable for anyone to use. It is
a fork of the [Metropolis Theme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme).

The fork was created for the following reasons:

- To fix some outstanding issues that had not been addressed for a long time.
- To remove some of the more opinionated design choices, such as special handling of the Fira family of fonts.
- To strip away some features that added complexity to the code base without achieving valuable functionality for the majority of users, such as special code block designs and the pgfplots theme.

[Here's a blog post](https://jolars.co/blog/2024-05-30-moloch/) in which I introduce the theme and write in more detail about the changes with respect to Metropolis.
Also see the [demo](examples/demo/demo.pdf) for a quick introduction to the theme.

Do not expect this theme to be backwards compatible with the Metropolis theme.

## Installation

Moloch is on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/moloch), so you can install it using your favorite LaTeX package manager. For example, with `tlmgr`:

```bash
tlmgr install moloch
```

You can also install the theme from source, in which case you need a working LaTeX installation with `l3build` installed. Then just follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jolars/moloch.git
cd moloch
l3build install
```

## Usage

The following code shows a minimal example of a Beamer presentation using
Moloch.

```latex
\documentclass{beamer}
\usetheme{moloch}
\title{A minimal example}
\date{\today}
\author{Johan Larsson}
\institute{Centre for Modern Beamer Themes}
\begin{document}
  \maketitle
  \section{First Section}
  \begin{frame}{First Frame}
    Hello, world!
  \end{frame}
\end{document}
```

Almost all of **moloch** is a result of Mathias Vogelgesang's (@matze) hard work on the
**metropolis theme** (of which **moloch** is a fork).

Thanks to @samcarter for the logo!
